# Unpaired-Rain-Removal-Algorithms

Rain removal algorithms that do not rely on paired datasets are classified into two main categories: 

Model-driven method that are independent of datasets and deep learning method that use unpaired datasets. The specific classification is shown below.



# Model-driven

# Pre-training model

Two Training dataset: 

1.Mix rain streaks and raindrop dataset: 

Includes 402 real raindrop images, 217 real rain streak images and 450 synthetic rain streak images with different rain sizes, totalling 1069 images and 1069 no rain images.

2.Raindrops dataset:

Includes 861 real raindrop images, and 861 no-rain images.

These two datasets are used to train the following models: CycleGAN, CUT, FastCUT, DCLGAN, and CycleGAN-turbo. Model links are provided below.
