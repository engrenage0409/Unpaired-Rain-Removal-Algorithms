# Pre-training model

**Two Training dataset: **

1.Mix rain streaks and raindrop dataset: Includes 402 real raindrop images, 217 real rain streak images and 450 synthetic rain streak images with different rain sizes, totalling 1069 images and 1069 no rain images.

2.Raindrops dataset: Includes 861 real raindrop images, and 861 no-rain images.

These two datasets are used to train the following models: CycleGAN, CUT, FastCUT, DCLGAN, and CycleGAN-turbo. Model links are provided below.
